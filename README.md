This is a project during which I will make a copy of google's homepage.  Startdate: June 6, 2017.

Update: June 7, 2017.
I have pretty much finished my copy of google's homepage. Overall, I felt like it went pretty well and was a good project to help me get a better handle of HTML and CSS. 

One issue I have is with the search bar. I'm not sure how to make it scale with the size of the browser the same way that google does. For now, it is set to a specific size.  Hopefully I can come back and fix it in the future.
